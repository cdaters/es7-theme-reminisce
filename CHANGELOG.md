# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Version 0.1.1] - 2024-10-05
### Changed
- I have reduced the resolution of all the background art for each system to 1280x720 from 1920x1080 to reduce overall overhead. These are background images afterall and sharp/crisp is not important for how these are utilized.
- I combined my idea of 'Detaled' and 'Detailed w/Boxart' into just 'Detailed.' I felt that the difference was so miniscule that really these could just be 'one' view as opposed to 'two.'
- I cleaned up the `README.md` file.

### Added
- I've added the views for Modern (*which was referred to as 'tiles' in the beginning*), Grid, and Carousel (*which was known as 'Boxes' in the beginning*).
- I've added this `CHANGELOG.md` file to track changes.

### Fixed
- Nothing yet, though I am sure there will be changes that will result in a 0.1.2 release!

## [Version 0.1.0] - 2024-09-24
### Added
- Initial commit of the Reminisce EmulationStation Theme for Batocera. Theme is mostly working but needs other views fleshed out and troubleshooting "stuff" is left behind in the way of art files, or bits of XML code and comments that are meaningful to me but might not make sense to others.
