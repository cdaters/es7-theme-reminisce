      <systemDescription> The Adventure Vision is a second-generation console developed by Entex Industries. It was released in 1982. The launch price of the system was $79.95.

The monitor, game controls, and computer hardware are all contained within a single portable unit. Despite being technically portable, most people opted to use its built-in AC adapter (it ate through batteries and was unwieldy to actually move about).

It built-in monitor utilized a single vertical line of 40 red LEDs and a rapidly spinning mechanical motor to create its images. A similar technique would later be used by Nintendo with the 1995 Virtual Boy.

It features a stellar library of 4 games, all arcade ports. It was discontinued a year later. </systemDescription>
