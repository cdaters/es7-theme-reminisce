      <systemDescription>The Commodore 128 is the last 8-bit home computer introduced in 1985 by Commodore International, just three years after its predecessor, the C64. The C128 is a significantly expanded successor to the C64, with nearly full compatibility. It is housed in a redesigned case with an improved keyboard including a numeric keypad and function keys. The C128 has three operating modes; C128 Mode (or native mode), CP/M Mode (a pre MS-DOS operating system aimed at business) and C64 Mode. The C128 was supposed to be the best of both business and gaming, but while it was a better business system than the C64, it was not a better gaming system. Approximately 2.5 million C128s were sold during it's four year production run.</systemDescription>
