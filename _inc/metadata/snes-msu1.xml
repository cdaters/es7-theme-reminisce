      <systemDescription>Based on a custom coprocessor enhancement chip that would allow playback of CD quality lossless audio, this allowed for the concept of the Super NES CD-ROM (commonly abbreviated to SNES-CD), an unreleased add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) video game console. It was built upon the functionality of the cartridge-based SNES by adding support for a CD-ROM-based format known as Super Disc.

The SNES-CD was developed in a joint venture between Nintendo and Sony. Sony also planned to release it as a hybrid console, the PlayStation, similar to Sharp's Twin Famicom and NEC's TurboDuo. Another partnership with Philips yielded a few Nintendo-themed games for the CD-i platform instead of the SNES-CD. </systemDescription>
